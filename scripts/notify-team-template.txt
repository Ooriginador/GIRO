Subject: [ACTION REQUIRED] Repo history rewritten — rotate secrets and re-clone

Hi team,

We performed a security remediation on the `GIRO` repository to remove
committed secrets from the Git history. Actions taken:

- Created a repository backup bundle: `repo-backup-*.bundle` (keep offline)
- Removed flagged files from history (see `scripts/gitleaks_report.json`)

What you must do now:
1) Rotate credentials immediately for any affected service (Stripe, license
   keys, JWT secrets, etc.). See `REPORTS/SECRETS_ROTATION_PLAYBOOK.md` for guidance.
2) Re-clone the repository (recommended):
   - `git clone <repo-url>`
   OR if you must keep local changes, rebase/reset onto the cleaned origin.
3) Update local development environment secrets as needed.

If you have any outstanding branches or local work, follow the instructions in
`REPORTS/SECRETS_ROTATION_PLAYBOOK.md` to rebase or preserve work before resetting.

If you want me to force-push the cleaned history to `origin`, reply with
`RUN_FORCE_PUSH` and I will perform the push and share the exact commands run.

Thanks,
Security Bot
